    <!-- This is a 4KB, page-aligned memory region at the physical address of
    0x3f215000, which is where the UART device registers are mapped to. Note, we
    are mapping in the Rpi3B's "Mini" UART device registers and NOT its "PL011"
    UART device registers. An important aspect to note that the base of the Mini
    UART device registers are actually mapped to 0x3f215040 in physical memory.
    Unfortunately, 0x3f215040 is not a 4K page-aligned address, so we can't map
    a page at that physical address. As such in our `serial_driver.c` code, we
    must remember to obtain the real base address of the Mini UART device by
    adding 0x40 to 0x3f215000. -->

    <!-- In the SDDF's design-documentation, `shared_dma` is referred to as the
    "Data Region". `shared_dma` is an array of I/O buffers that will be used to
    pass/transport data from `serial_client` to `serial_driver` and vice-versa.
    The `shared_dma` memory region MUST be mapped at the exact same virtual
    memory address in all the PDs that use the `shared_dma`. If they aren't
    mapped to the same address, the SDDF's ring buffer mechanism of transporting
    data across PDs will NOT work. This is because the SDDF's ring buffer
    mechanism passes the virtual address of a `shared_dma` buffer from PD to PD,
    which enables the SDDF's transport mechanism to be zero-copy. Theoretically,
    the requirement to map the `shared_dma` to the same virtual address in
    various PDs could be alleviated if there existed a mechanism to translate
    virtual addresses across PDs (VSpaces); however, such a mechanism does NOT
    currently exist. -->

        The mini-UART from the AUX peripheral triggers IRQ 29 ("Aux int")
        on the VideoCore, which then signals pending GPU interrupts
        to the ARM core.

        The PL011 triggers IRQ 57 ("uart_int").

        The seL4 kernel's interrupt controller driver creates a linear mapping
        of all interrupts in the system (see
        include/drivers/bcm2836-armctrl-ic.h) with 32 ARM PPIs, 32 basic
        interrupts and 64 GPU interrupts.

        Thus, the actual interrupts to be used in userland are: 93 (=32+32+29).
        mini-UART 32+32+29 = 93
        PL011 UART 32+32+57 = 121
